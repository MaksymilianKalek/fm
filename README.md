# Fabryka-Mruczenia

This project is a full-stack application created for a volunteers organization helping homeless kittens find new homes. It has basic CRUD functionalities. For a few months it was actively used by the organisation, before they switched to other means of communication. It uses AWS s3 for storing the images and it was deployed to Heroku.
